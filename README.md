# Blog Site
 The open source code of my blog site

This GitHub repo will contain information on the creation of my blog site, my goal, the purpose and about me typical things.

<h1>User Requirements</h1>

I will make this blog able to make posts anonymously without any attached location information about a user or a post the user has made. I will make a secure authentication based system which is not vulnerable to SQL Injection or other methods of attacks such as XSS ( Cross Site Scripting Attack ). My authentication system will allow user to create an account get an account number and set their own username. This blog site will allow for me to document things I am doing in life such as educational wise and work wise. The blog site will allow for comments, likes and dislikes. No files will be allowed to be uploaded. I want to make nice graphical user Interface what is appealing to the user.

<h1>Requirements</h1>

This will require me to have a SQL Server what will store the account numbers. The account numbers will be randomly generated 32 character long number this makes sure for full authentication from brute force attacks and there will not be any stored passwords on the user as they will log in via their account number. A hosting service to host my web page on, a DNS server. And preventive measures against cyber-attacks. To prevent mass botting I will have to configure up a Cloudflare preventive measure on the web page.

<h1>Skills Needed</h1>

SQL
Cybersecurity
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Networking

<h1>Web Hosting Service</h1>

For my web hosting service I'm going to use, Hostinger as it offers some good deals with additional measures in security such as Cloudflare, Privacy protection on whois lookup and standard DDoS protection. These are extremely useful for the blog site I am going to create. The plan I'm going to take is the Business which is currently offered at Â£3.79 due to huge discount when price is increased I may change my host as I do not want to pay, 11.99 Monthly for server I will not make money off. It also provides 3 Months free this is extremely useful for me and nice for testing purposes without being on clock worrying about the next transaction for the up-coming 3 months.

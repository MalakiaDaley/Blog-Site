# Blog Site
 The open source code of my blog site

This GitHub repo will contain information on the creation of my blog site, my goal, the purpose and about me typical things.

<h1>User Requirements</h1>

I will make this blog able to make posts anonymously without any attached location information about a user or a post the user has made. I will make a secure authentication based system which is not vulnerable to SQL Injection or other methods of attacks such as XSS ( Cross Site Scripting Attack ). My authentication system will allow user to create an account get an account number and set their own username. This blog site will allow for me to document things I am doing in life such as educational wise and work wise. The blog site will allow for comments, likes and dislikes. No files will be allowed to be uploaded. I want to make nice graphical user Interface what is appealing to the user.
